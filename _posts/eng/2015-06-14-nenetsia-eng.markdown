Some month ago we returned from two weeks long fieldwork period in Nenetsia. The settlements we worked in were Naryan-Mar, Hongurey and Krasnoye. We are currently preparing the data collected, we will soon be able to send ready videos to the informants. Transcribing is also ongoing work, naturally.

Not so much is ready yet, so here we have some examples from our work.
