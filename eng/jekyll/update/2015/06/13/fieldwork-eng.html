  <article class="post-content">
    <p>We have planned three different fieldwork trips for the time between 2014 and 2016. The first trip was carried out in March 2014 in Ižma region of Komi Republic. The original plan was to work only outside the Komi Republic, but in the end it made more sense to start our work in more familiar lands. Two members of our team, Marina Fedina and Vasiley Chuprov, are both from Ižma region which gave us a huge advantage in planning the work. It was also good to start easily as we also had to get to know each others. This was anyway just the first time our team was working together.</p>

<p>During two weeks we visited the following villages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ižma</li>
  <li>Dijur</li>
  <li>Sizyabsk</li>
  <li>Gam</li>
  <li>Krasnobor</li>
  <li>Vertep</li>
  <li>Galpi</li>
</ul>

<p>There were of course many other settlements where we had no chance to visit. Nevertheless, we covered a rather large portion of Ižma river basin.</p>

<h2 id="goals-of-our-work">Goals of our work</h2>

<p>I think it is always very important to ask what are the reasons to conduct new fieldwork. It is clear that lots of work has been carried out in the last hundred years: there is an abundance of all kinds of data. What’s reason why we also feel it is necessary to contribute directly to production of new materials? There are several reasons.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is little data that is technically excellent</li>
  <li>We need some data with very thick layers of metadata in order to develop better tools</li>
  <li>It seems that the interactive speech situations are not common within the existing corpus</li>
  <li>The copyrights for older data tend to be murky, and it is unclear what can be made freely available</li>
</ul>

<p>Naturally this means that we attempt to produce data that is on technically very high quality, openly available as far as possible and interacts well with the newest research tools at the software and server sides of the things.</p>

<p>Here are some photographs from our work.</p>
