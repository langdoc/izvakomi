It is clear that not all material can be made publicly available. However, having data behind secure but complicated systems often also makes it certain that the individuals whose data we are talking about can't really access it. It has been pointed out many times that the idea about absolute need to anonymize and close everything is maybe more related to North American and Australian standards, than what is actually relevant in all parts of the world. With out informants it seems very clear that people want to have access to what we have done, they want to be able to see it easily and share it among people dear to them.

Thereby we have set up a YouTube channel for disseminating some of our recordings. These are not complete sessions, but coherent unified pieces which, we believe, are interesting in themselves. First video uploaded is from Vertep Culture House. In this case we have also written permission to share the video. This is a bit unusual, because in our daily work it has not been perceived as very appropriate to ask informants to sign some documents. This simply has not been viewed as trust-invocing thing to do. But what we have always stressed is that if the informants are not satisfied with the work they see, they always have right to ask us to remove it.

Lately we have often been working with two cameras. This makes cutting the video much more interesting, but also rises new questions. Should the video of two videos be cut together nicely, or would it be better to have two distinct video files between which an user of ELAN file could orientate? This would not make sense as an aesthetic solution, but technically may increase the value of the video. It is also an open question can we even cut the video? Is it ok to remove something? How to indicate when that is done? Please continue reading **here**, if you are interested about theoretical aspects of video making in documentary linguistics.
